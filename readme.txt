The easiest way to allow your users, and even guests, to create posts/content from a page on your WordPress-based site.

== Description ==
The easiest way to allow your users, and even guests, to create posts/content on your WordPress-based site. uCan post adds a configurable submission form to a page on your site allowing users to contribute content to your site. The best part about this is that your users/guests don't have to access the dashboard. With just a handful of simple yet powerful settings you can have this all setup in under 3 minutes. uCan Post imitates the regular WordPress post/page editor and even allows Media Uploads.
